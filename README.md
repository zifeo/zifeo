# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently the Chief Technology Officer at [KiWI](https://conkiwi.com), and
previously served as [Smood](https://smood.ch)'s CTO and CDO. Prior to that, I
studied at EPFL and had experiences at Amazon, CERN, the Eclipse Foundation and
successfully

my first start-up digitizing the Swiss food industry.

I spend most of my time building efficient systems, growing both people and the
engineering capabilities of organizations. I occasionally also

technology, engineering and systems of all kinds.
