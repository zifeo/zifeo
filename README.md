# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a fractional Chief Technology Officer at
[KiWi](https://conkiwi.com) and [Exponent](https://exponent.ch). I previously
served as [Smood](https://smood.ch)'s CTO and CDO after
[exiting](https://agefi.com/actualites/entreprises/la-start-up-genevoise-apety-officialise-son-rachat-par-la-societe-de-livraison-romande-smood)
my first start-up in foodtech. Prior to that, I studied neuro, computer & data
sciences at [EPFL](https://github.com/zifeo/EPFL) and worked at Amazon, CERN and
the Eclipse Foundation.

I spend most of my time building efficient systems, growing both people and the
engineering capabilities of organizations. When I am not coaching or consulting,
I [chase](https://facebook.com/whitehat/thanks) security bounties and
occasionally write about technology, engineering and systems of all kinds.
